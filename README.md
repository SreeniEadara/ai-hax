# Berkeley AI Hackathon
Elements of AI in Biotech
	-Develop pseudoknots using machine learning
	-Better artificial RNA codes for creating specific proteins and other biological tools
	-Uses of pseudoknots
		-Temperature sensitive catalysts that facilitate protein production (translation)
		-Control gene expression
		-Gene circuits to deliver drugs
		-Localize delivery with temperature sensitive RNA pseudoknots
	-Current problems with pseudoknot modeling software
		-Closed-source
		-Few researchers have access to comprehensive 
		-Gatekeeping of resources by academia
	-Some use computational methods
	-Others use Machine Learning (ML) based methods
	-We will use ML based methods for developing pseudoknots
New plan is focused on synthesizing protein sequences based on user defined conditions using the GPT 4 language model
	Benefits:
		-
	Limitations:
		-Fails to provide consistent and accurate protein sequences with highly specific parameters using th
