## Elements of AI in Biotech

New plan is focused on synthesizing protein sequences based on user defined conditions using the GPT 4 language model.

Benefits:
- Fast, easy method to generate fusion proteins with several functions. Does not require extensive literature search.

Limitations:
- Fails to provide consistent and accurate protein sequences with highly specific parameters

List of domain parameters well understood by reccomendation model:
```
antibody, ribosome, cholesterol
```

List of domains not well understood by reccomendation model:
```
pH levels, water solubility, hydrophilicity 
```
